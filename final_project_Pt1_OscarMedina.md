# Final Project Part I

#### Summary 

For my summer internship, I worked at the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA), the economic development arm of the City of Pittsburgh. One of the things they had me do was update their neighborhood business district profiles. Primary, the task involved pulling data from Esri Business Analyst and collating information into a pdf template. The profiles are distributed at community meetings and also live on the URA website. Except for 2020, the URA updates these profiles every year. 

There are over 50 unique main-street businesses districts in Pittsburgh. The URA releases the business district profiles to inform the public and prospective business owners about market conditions in each neighborhood. They are fact sheets meant to give people a snapshot view of the business landscape.
